# Question
# --------
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


# Answer
# ------
# 906609


# Notes
# -----
# My solution is brute force. A better solution is below. However neat it is, I didn't find this challenge very edifying.
